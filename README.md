## Why a repo?
There's a bunch (maybe millions?) of articles, tutorials, blogs and all other kind of stuff about WordPress, written by different people thorugh years. The goal of this handbook is to gather the most valueable pieces of information about WordPress in a single repo where things are as straightforward as posibble, easy to find, and without clutter. 
> âš  The handbook isn't still mature, thus the folder and file structure may change over time.

## Why just headless WordPress?
The handbook is focused on developers, Jamstackers, and people who want to use WordPress *CMS* with the frontend technology of their choice. Theme development, Page builders or any other thing dealing with the "frontend" part of WordPress is out of the scope of this handbook, but customizating admin panel, leveraging security or creating new blocks is not limited to headless WordPress.  
Anyone using WordPress in a part of their stack can benfit from this handbook ðŸ˜‰
